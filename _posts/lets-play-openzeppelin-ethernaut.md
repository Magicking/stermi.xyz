title: 'Let’s play OpenZeppelin Ethernaut CTF — learning Solidity security while playing!'
excerpt: 'The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based war game created by OpenZeppelin.

Each level is a smart contract that needs to be ‘hacked’. The game acts both as a tool for those interested in learning Ethereum, and as a way to catalog historical hacks in levels. Levels can be infinite, and the game does not require to be played in any particular order.

[The Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) is a Web3/Solidity based war game created by [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/).

Each level is a smart contract that needs to be ‘hacked’. The game acts both as a tool for those interested in learning Ethereum, and as a way to catalog historical hacks in levels. Levels can be infinite, and the game does not require to be played in any particular order.

## How to play

If you want to play it by your own, just go to the [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) website and start solving the challenges.

Otherwise, you could clone my own [personal repository](https://github.com/StErMi/foundry-ethernaut), remove the solutions in the `test` folder and build your own! I have explained in the README file how to do it, and it should be pretty easy.

## Solutions to each puzzle

Each day I will publish the solution to a new challenge, so stay tuned.

- More to come…
